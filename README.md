# pg_pytorch
Library with implementation of most popular Policy Gradient methods for Reinforcement Learning

TODO:
* debug TRPO
* effective vectorization with n-step returns
* asynchronous workflow
* implement K-FAC optimizer for ConvNets
* adjust convnets
* adjust K-FAC for FCnets

What do we want:
* A2C
* A3C
* TRPO
* ACKTR

What can we add later:
* PPO
